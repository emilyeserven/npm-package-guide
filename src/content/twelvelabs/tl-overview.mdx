<SectionIntro>
TwelveLabs is a video understanding platform that provides AI-powered APIs for searching, analyzing, and generating embeddings from video content. Unlike generic vision models that process individual frames, TwelveLabs' models are **video-native** — they understand temporal relationships, spoken words, visual context, and audio signals together.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-platform">The Platform</SectionSubheading>

TwelveLabs processes video content across **multiple modalities simultaneously** — visual frames, audio tracks, speech/dialogue, and on-screen text. This multimodal approach means search queries like "the part where someone explains gradient descent near a whiteboard" actually work.

<SectionNote>
Unlike frame-by-frame image analysis, TwelveLabs' models understand **temporal relationships** — they know that events happen in sequence and can track context across an entire video.
