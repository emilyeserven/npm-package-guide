<SectionIntro>
Security mistakes in AI-generated code are especially dangerous because the code often looks correct and passes basic testing. AI models routinely generate XSS vectors<FnRef n={1} />, expose secrets in client bundles, use insecure auth patterns, and build queries with string concatenation. Always include explicit security requirements<FnRef n={2} /> in your prompts and CLAUDE.md.

<ColItem><strong>MCP Servers:</strong> Use the <strong>Fetch</strong> MCP server to pull OWASP cheat sheets during security reviews, or <strong>Brave Search</strong> MCP to look up CVEs for packages the AI recommends.</ColItem>
<ColItem><strong>CLI Tools:</strong> Run a security audit on AI-generated code: <code>git diff --staged | claude -p "Review for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities"</code></ColItem>
<ColItem><strong>Claude Skills:</strong> Create a <code>/project:security-review</code> slash command that checks for XSS, injection, secret exposure, and insecure auth patterns against your CLAUDE.md security rules.</ColItem>
