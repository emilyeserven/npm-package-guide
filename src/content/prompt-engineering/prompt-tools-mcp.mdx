<SectionIntro>
The Model Context Protocol<FnRef n={1} /> (MCP) is an open standard that connects Claude to external tools<FnRef n={2} /> and data sources. MCP servers run as separate processes that expose tools Claude can call during a conversation &mdash; giving it access to databases, APIs, file systems, and custom tools through a unified interface.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-overview">How MCP Works</SectionSubheading>

MCP uses a client-server architecture. Claude Code acts as the MCP client, and each server exposes a specific set of tools. Servers can run locally via stdio transport (launched with <code>npx</code> or <code>node</code>) or remotely via SSE (Server-Sent Events) over HTTP.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-best-for">Best Use Cases</SectionSubheading>

MCP servers are most valuable when Claude needs access to information or capabilities outside its built-in tools. Here are the scenarios where they shine.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-setup">Setting Up MCP Servers</SectionSubheading>

Configuring MCP servers is straightforward &mdash; just add a JSON file with the server definitions. Project-level configs are shared with your team via git; global configs are personal.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-servers">Popular Community Servers</SectionSubheading>

The MCP ecosystem has a growing library of community-maintained servers. Here are the most useful ones for development workflows:

<SectionList>
<ColItem><strong>GitHub</strong><FnRef n={3} /> &mdash; Full GitHub API access: create and manage issues, review PRs, search code across repositories, and manage branches. Especially valuable in mono-repo workflows.</ColItem>
<ColItem><strong>Fetch</strong><FnRef n={4} /> &mdash; Read and parse web content. Pull documentation, check API references, or read changelogs directly into Claude&rsquo;s context during code reviews.</ColItem>
<ColItem><strong>Brave Search</strong><FnRef n={5} /> &mdash; Web search from within Claude. Check for known CVEs in packages, find migration guides, or research best practices without leaving your terminal.</ColItem>
<ColItem><strong>Memory</strong><FnRef n={6} /> &mdash; Persistent knowledge graph that survives across sessions. Remember architecture decisions, team preferences, and project history.</ColItem>
<ColItem><strong>Filesystem</strong><FnRef n={7} /> &mdash; Secure access to files outside the working directory with configurable permission boundaries. Read design tokens, shared configs, or monorepo packages.</ColItem>
