<SectionIntro>
Claude Code can be much faster and cheaper when you optimize how you send context and consume results. Headless mode<FnRef n={1} />, piped input, structured output, and unix tool integration let you build powerful automation pipelines<FnRef n={2} /> where Claude is one step in a larger workflow.

The core principle is simple: send less, scope narrowly, and consume results programmatically. Every optimization below reduces either cost, latency, or both.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-best-for">Best Use Cases</SectionSubheading>

Performance optimization matters most in automated and high-frequency workflows where speed and cost compound.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-implementation">Implementation Guide</SectionSubheading>

Start with headless mode for any scripted task. Then layer in piped context, tool authorization, and batch processing as your workflows grow.
