<SectionIntro>
AI coding assistants frequently generate tests that look correct but contain subtle mistakes &mdash; flaky E2E tests<FnRef n={3} />, implementation-coupled unit tests<FnRef n={2} />, and missing edge case coverage. This section documents the most common testing mistakes and how to prevent them with better prompts. New to frontend testing? See the <NavLink to="test-overview" /> for foundational concepts, and <NavLink to="test-best-practices" /> for general do's and don'ts.
