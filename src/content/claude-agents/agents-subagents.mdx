<SectionIntro>
Subagents are specialized agent instances that run in their own context window. They have custom system prompts, specific tool access, and independent permissions. When Claude encounters a task matching a subagent's description, it delegates automatically.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-what-sub">What Are Subagents?</SectionSubheading>

Think of subagents as specialists on a team. Rather than one agent trying to do everything, Claude can delegate to focused agents that each excel at a narrow task. Each subagent gets its own context window, so the main agent's context stays clean.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-builtin">Built-in Subagents</SectionSubheading>

<DefinitionTable>
  <DefRow term="Explore">A fast, read-only agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases. Tools: Read, Grep, Glob. Claude delegates to it when it needs to search without making changes.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="Plan">A research agent used during plan mode to gather context before presenting a plan. Tools: Read, Grep, Glob. Keeps exploration out of your main context window.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="General-purpose">A capable agent for complex, multi-step tasks requiring both exploration and action. Tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob. Used when the task needs both reading and writing.</DefRow>
</DefinitionTable>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-custom">Creating Custom Subagents</SectionSubheading>

Custom subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Place them in `.claude/agents/` in your project (project-scoped) or `~/.claude/agents/` in your home directory (global).

You are a senior application security engineer with deep
expertise in the OWASP Top 10, secure coding practices,
and common vulnerability patterns.

## Your Process

1. Search for authentication and authorization logic
2. Look for input validation and sanitization
3. Check for SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF patterns
4. Review secrets management and configuration
5. Identify insecure dependencies

## Output Format

For each finding, provide:
- Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- Location: file path and line range
- Description: what the vulnerability is
- Recommendation: how to fix it
- Reference: relevant CWE or OWASP reference

## Rules

- Never modify any files
- If you're unsure about a finding, flag it as
  "Needs Review" rather than ignoring it
- Always check both the happy path and error paths
```

<Explainer title="Managing subagents">
You can use `/agents` in Claude Code to see all configured subagents. Use the `memory` frontmatter field to let a subagent persist learnings across sessions.
