<SectionIntro>
The quality of your agent's instructions directly determines the quality of its output. Whether you're writing a SKILL.md, a subagent prompt, or a system prompt for the Agent SDK, these guidelines apply.

Use this interactive checklist to ensure your instructions cover the essentials:

**Be specific, not vague**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bad:** | "Review the code and make it better" |
| **Good:** | "Review TypeScript files in /src for unused variables, missing error handling, and functions longer than 50 lines. Output findings as JSON." |

**Define boundaries explicitly**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bad:** | "Fix any issues you find in the codebase" |
| **Good:** | "Fix ESLint errors in files under /src/components. Do not modify test files, configuration files, or any file outside /src/components." |

**Include verification steps**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bad:** | "Write tests for the auth module" |
| **Good:** | "Write tests for the auth module. Run them with `npm test`. If any fail, debug and fix them. Only report success when all tests pass." |

Don't dump everything into a single prompt. Structure your instructions in layers: start with the high-level goal, then provide process steps, then detailed rules. Skills do this naturally through the SKILL.md + subdirectory structure, where Claude loads deeper files only when needed.

<Gotcha>
The most common mistake is giving too little context about what "good" looks like. If you wouldn't be confident a new hire could do the task with only your instructions, Claude probably can't either.
</Gotcha>
