<SectionIntro>
The **Django stack** pairs Python's most popular web framework with a modern JavaScript frontend. Django follows the "batteries included" philosophy<FnRef n={1} /> &mdash; it comes with an admin panel, ORM, authentication, and security protections built in. If you know Python, Django gets you from zero to production faster than almost anything else.

<ColItem>**Batteries included** &mdash; Django ships with an admin panel, ORM, auth system, form handling, and security protections. You don't need to assemble these from separate packages.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Python-powered** &mdash; If your team already knows Python or needs data science / ML integration, Django lets you use the same language on the backend.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Strong security defaults** &mdash; Django protects against CSRF, XSS, SQL injection, and clickjacking out of the box, with no extra configuration needed.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="Django &mdash; a backend analogy">
Django is like choosing Spring Boot for Java or ASP.NET for C# — an opinionated, feature-rich framework where the ecosystem gives you most of what you need out of the box. The built-in admin panel alone is worth its weight in gold for internal tools. The trade-off is that you're now running two languages (Python backend + JavaScript frontend), which means two package ecosystems, two build systems, and two sets of conventions. For teams that already live in Python, this is a non-issue. For JavaScript-first teams, it adds overhead.
