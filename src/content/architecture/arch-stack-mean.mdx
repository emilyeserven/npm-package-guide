<SectionIntro>
The **MEAN** stack &mdash; **MongoDB**, **Express**, **Angular**, **Node.js** &mdash; is like MERN but swaps React for Angular. While React is a library that lets you choose your own tools, Angular is a full framework with routing, forms, HTTP, and more built in. Everything else stays the same.

<ColItem>**Full framework frontend** &mdash; Angular includes routing, form handling, HTTP client, dependency injection, and testing utilities out of the box. No need to choose separate libraries.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**TypeScript-first** &mdash; Angular was built with TypeScript from the start, making it a natural fit for teams that want strong typing everywhere.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Enterprise-friendly** &mdash; Angular's opinionated structure keeps large codebases consistent across many developers, which is why it's popular in enterprise teams.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="MEAN &mdash; a backend analogy">
If MERN is like choosing Flask (lightweight, pick your own tools), MEAN with Angular is like choosing Spring Boot (opinionated, everything included). Angular gives you more structure and built-in tooling at the cost of flexibility. For large teams where consistency matters more than freedom, this trade-off is often worth it — the same reason enterprise backend teams often choose Spring over lighter alternatives.
