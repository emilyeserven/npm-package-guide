<SectionIntro>
**Remix** was a pioneering full-stack React framework created by the React Router team (Ryan Florence and Michael Jackson). It championed web standards, progressive enhancement, and nested routing. Its ideas now live on in React Router v7 Framework Mode &mdash; understanding Remix helps you understand the patterns behind modern React frameworks.

<SectionList>
<ColItem>**Web standards pioneer** &mdash; Remix built everything on Fetch API Request/Response, standard HTML forms, and HTTP caching. Skills learned transfer to any platform.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Loader/action pattern** &mdash; Remix pioneered co-located server-side data fetching (loaders) and mutation handling (actions) for React, with automatic revalidation.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Per-route error boundaries** &mdash; if a nested route crashes, only that section shows an error &mdash; the rest stays functional. This pattern was later adopted by Next.js and others.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="Remix &mdash; a backend analogy">
Remix is like the Unix philosophy applied to web frameworks &mdash; small, composable primitives built on the platform. It&apos;s like choosing POSIX-standard tools over vendor-specific CLI tools: you learn transferable skills that work everywhere, not just in one ecosystem.
