<SectionIntro>
The **Rails stack** is built around Ruby on Rails &mdash; a framework famous for "convention over configuration"<FnRef n={1} /> and developer happiness. GitHub, Shopify, and Basecamp were built with it. Rails makes hundreds of decisions for you so you can focus on building features instead of setting up boilerplate.

<SectionList>
<ColItem>**Convention over configuration** &mdash; Rails decides how to organize files, name database tables, and structure routes. Follow the conventions and things just work.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Ship fast** &mdash; Rails can scaffold entire features (models, views, controllers, database migrations) with a single command. Rapid development is a core philosophy.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Hotwire for modern frontends** &mdash; Rails' Hotwire<FnRef n={2} /> approach (Turbo + Stimulus) delivers interactive UIs with minimal JavaScript, or you can integrate React for complex frontends.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="Rails &mdash; a backend analogy">
Rails is like an opinionated CLI tool that generates your entire project structure. If you've used Spring Initializr, Create React App, or `django-admin startproject`, imagine that level of scaffolding applied to everything — database schemas, API endpoints, tests, even email templates. The "magic" comes from metaprogramming: Rails uses Ruby's dynamic features to infer behavior from naming conventions. The upside is incredible productivity. The downside is that when conventions break or you need to do something non-standard, debugging the magic can feel like reverse-engineering a black box.
