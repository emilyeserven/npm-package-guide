# Git Worktrees & Claude Code Guide

## Audience & Purpose

For developers who want to use git worktrees for parallel development, particularly with AI coding assistants like Claude Code. Covers worktree concepts, setup, management, and real workflow patterns.

## Interactive Components

- `WorktreeDiagram` — Visual tree showing bare repo branching to worktree directories
- `GuideChecklist` — Cleanup checklist (`checklistId="git-worktrees"`)

## Guide-Specific Conventions

- **Flat section structure:** Original HTML had step-based tabs; converted to flat scrollable sections with `SectionSubheading` headers
- **Code blocks:** Standard markdown fenced code blocks with `bash` language tag
- **Emoji in subheadings:** Use Unicode escapes: `{'\u{emoji}'}`
