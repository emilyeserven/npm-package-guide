<SectionIntro>
A webhook is an HTTP request that a server sends **to your server** when something interesting happens. That's it. It's just an HTTP POST request with a JSON payload, sent automatically in response to an event.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-concept">The core concept</SectionSubheading>

The key insight is the **direction**: instead of *you* asking a service for updates, the service *tells you* when something changes. This is the fundamental difference between polling and webhooks.

<Explainer>
Think of it like the difference between `setInterval` polling an API versus an `EventSource` / `WebSocket` pushing you updates. Except with webhooks, the "push" is a plain HTTP POST from their server to yours — no persistent connection needed.

  <DefRow term="Polling (the old way)" definition={`"Hey Stripe, any new payments?" repeated every 30 seconds. Wastes requests, adds latency, and can hit rate limits.`} />
  <DefRow term="Webhooks (the smart way)" definition={`"Stripe, POST to this URL when someone pays." Instant notifications, zero wasted requests, scales beautifully.`} />

If you've done any frontend work with third-party services, you've probably been on the receiving end of webhooks without realizing it:
