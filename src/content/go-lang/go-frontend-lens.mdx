<SectionIntro>
You've spent years building UIs with React and TypeScript. Here's what to expect, what'll trip you up, and what'll click immediately.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-familiar">What will feel familiar vs alien</SectionSubheading>

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-3 my-5">
  <SectionNote>
  **What will feel familiar:** Static typing, JSON handling (struct tags are like schema definitions), module systems (`go mod` ≈ `npm`), and the concept of interfaces. Your TypeScript intuition translates surprisingly well.
  </SectionNote>

  <Gotcha title="What will feel alien">
  No ternary expressions, no spread operator, no destructuring, no `Array.map/filter/reduce`. You'll write a lot of `for` loops. There's no optional chaining either.
  </Gotcha>

<Gotcha title="Skip Go when...">
Don't reach for Go for: **data science / ML** (use Python), **complex ORMs and database migrations** (TypeScript ecosystem with Prisma/Drizzle is better here), or if your entire team is already deep in the Node.js ecosystem and there's no performance bottleneck to solve.
</Gotcha>
