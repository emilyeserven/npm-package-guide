<SectionIntro>
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static type annotations — like adding type hints to Python, or going from a dynamic language to a compiled one. You write code with types (function greet(name: string): string), and the TypeScript compiler checks for mistakes before your code ever runs. It catches bugs like calling a function with the wrong argument type, accessing a property that doesn't exist, or returning the wrong type. Almost all modern JavaScript projects use TypeScript, and npm packages are expected to ship type information.

<ColItem>Your types only matter to your own team. Nobody outside your project sees them.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Your tsconfig.json<FnRef n={3} /> (TypeScript config) is tuned for your specific app and bundler.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Type errors are caught during development — they don't affect your deployed app since TypeScript compiles away to plain JavaScript.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-pkg">{'\u{1F4E6}'} NPM Package</SectionSubheading>
<SectionList>
<ColItem>You MUST ship type declaration files<FnRef n={1} /> (.d.ts) alongside your JavaScript. These tell consumers what types your functions accept and return.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Your types ARE your public API contract<FnRef n={4} />. If a function signature changes, that's a breaking change<FnRef n={5} />. See the publishing guide<FnRef n={2} /> for how to ship them correctly.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Tools like tsup auto-generate .d.ts files from your TypeScript source. Without them, consumers get no autocomplete or type checking.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<Explainer title="What are .d.ts files?">
Declaration files (.d.ts) are like header files in C or interface definitions in Java/Go. They describe the shape of your code — function signatures, types, exported classes — without the actual implementation. They let TypeScript users get autocomplete, type checking, and inline docs when using your package.
</Explainer>

<Gotcha>
⚠️ Forgetting to ship .d.ts files is the #1 complaint about npm packages. It's like publishing a REST API with no documentation — technically usable, but painful.
