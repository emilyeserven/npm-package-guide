JavaScript projects follow a common folder convention you'll see almost everywhere:

- **src/** — your source code: TypeScript, JSX, styles, and everything you write
- **dist/** (or **build/**, **out/**) — compiled output generated by your build tool
- **node_modules/** — installed dependencies (never commit this to Git)
- **test/** or **\_\_tests\_\_/** — test files
- **.github/** — CI workflows and GitHub configuration
- **package.json**, **tsconfig.json**, **.eslintrc** — config files at the project root

<pre className="code-block">{`my-package/

<SectionNote>📋 This sample shows the structure of a **single package** — either the entire codebase in a monolith setup, or just one package within a larger monorepo. For what a monorepo looks like at the repo level (with multiple packages side by side), see the <NavLink to="monorepo">🏗️ Sample Monorepo Structure</NavLink> in the Monorepo vs Monolith section.</SectionNote>

The distinction between **src/** and **dist/** becomes especially important when building npm packages — understanding what goes where is key to publishing correctly. See the Web App vs NPM Package sections for more on this.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-col1">{'\u{1F4DD}'} src/ (source)</SectionSubheading>
<SectionList>
<ColItem>src/ is where you write your code: TypeScript, JSX, SCSS, config files, tests — everything that makes up the development version of your project.</ColItem>
<ColItem>This is YOUR workspace. It may contain syntax that browsers or Node.js can't run directly (like TypeScript or JSX), so it needs to be compiled before it can be used.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Think of it like .java or .go source files — they need a compilation step before they're usable. src/ should never be published to npm.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-col2">{'\u{1F4E6}'} dist/ (distributable)</SectionSubheading>
<SectionList>
<ColItem>dist/ (short for 'distributable') contains the compiled, ready-to-use output of your package. This is what consumers actually run when they install your package.</ColItem>
<ColItem>It's generated by your build tool (tsup, Rollup, Vite, etc.) and typically contains: compiled .js files (ESM and/or CJS), type declarations (.d.ts), and sometimes CSS.</ColItem>
<ColItem>You publish ONLY dist/ to npm. It's the finished product — like shipping a compiled .jar instead of raw .java files, or a REST API instead of database schemas.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<Explainer title="Why not just ship the source code?">
Three reasons. First, consumers might not have your build tools — if your src/ uses TypeScript but they use plain JavaScript, they can't compile your code. Second, the compiled output is optimized: dead code is removed, modules are resolved, and the code is ready to run. Third, shipping src/ exposes internals you don't want people depending on — it's like giving someone access to your database schema when they only need a REST API. The dist/ folder is your package's public interface: clean, compiled, and intentional. As a fallback, you can also use .npmignore<FnRef n={3} /> to exclude files, though the 'files' whitelist approach is preferred.
</Explainer>

<Gotcha>
⚠️ When publishing a package, only dist/ should go to npm — everything else (src/, tests, configs, node_modules) is part of your development workflow, not what consumers receive. If you accidentally publish src/, you're shipping uncompiled TypeScript that consumers can't use directly, plus bloating their node_modules with files they don't need. Always use the 'files' field<FnRef n={1} /> in package.json to whitelist only dist/. Use <Cmd npm="npm pack --dry-run" pnpm="pnpm pack --dry-run" /><FnRef n={2} /> to preview exactly what will be included.
</Gotcha>
