<ColItem>The distinction between 'dependencies' and 'devDependencies' in package.json is mostly organizational. Everything gets bundled anyway.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Bundle size matters for performance, but it's your call how to balance that.</ColItem>

<ColItem>Every dependency you add becomes a dependency for EVERYONE who installs your package. Keep them minimal.</ColItem>
<ColItem>There are 3 types that matter: 'dependencies'<FnRef n={1} /> (shipped with your package), 'devDependencies' (only for building/testing), and 'peerDependencies'<FnRef n={2} /> (the consumer must provide these).</ColItem>
<ColItem>peerDependencies are crucial: if your package uses React, list React as a peerDependency so consumers use THEIR copy, not a second one.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="What's peerDependencies?">
Imagine you write a plugin for Express.js. You don't want to bundle your own copy of Express — you want to use whatever version the developer already has. That's what peerDependencies does. You're saying: 'I need this to work, but YOU provide it.' For frontend packages, React is the most common peerDependency.
</Explainer>

<Gotcha>
⚠️ Classic mistake: putting React in 'dependencies' instead of 'peerDependencies'. This installs a SECOND copy of React in the consumer's project, causing mysterious crashes. It's like having two different versions of a database driver loaded at once.
</Gotcha>
