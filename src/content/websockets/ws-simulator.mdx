<SectionIntro>
This is a fully simulated WebSocket connection running in your browser. It behaves like a real echo server — send a message and it comes back. You can also see ping/pong heartbeats keeping the connection alive.

<SectionList>
  <ColItem>**Connect and disconnect** — watch the status dot and log entries for the full connection lifecycle.</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Send JSON** — the preset button sends a structured JSON message, mimicking a real chat application.</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Send Binary** — simulates sending a Float64 value as an ArrayBuffer. In real apps, binary is used for audio streams, game state, and file transfer.</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Send 10 rapid** — fires 10 messages in quick succession to demonstrate how WebSocket handles burst traffic with minimal overhead.</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Watch heartbeats** — after connecting, ping/pong messages appear every 8 seconds to keep the connection alive.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<Explainer>
In a real application, the echo server would be replaced by your backend logic — routing messages to other clients, saving to a database, or broadcasting to a channel. The WebSocket API on the client side stays exactly the same.
