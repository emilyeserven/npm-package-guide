<SectionIntro>
Payload's mental model centers around four building blocks: Collections, Globals, Fields, and Hooks. Everything else flows from these.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-building-blocks">The building blocks</SectionSubheading>

Payload's architecture is intentionally simple. Once you understand these five concepts, you can build almost anything:

<SectionList>
  <ColItem>**Collections** — database tables with typed schemas, APIs, and admin UI</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Globals** — singleton documents for site-wide settings</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Fields** — the schema primitives that define your data shape</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Hooks** — lifecycle callbacks for custom logic at any data operation</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Access Control** — functions that gate read/write at collection and field level</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<Explainer title="Reusable fields">
Fields are just objects. You can extract common patterns (like a slug field or SEO group) into shared modules and import them across collections. This is plain TypeScript composition — no special plugin API required.
