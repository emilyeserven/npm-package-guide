<SectionIntro>
Payload operates as your backend layer, exposing your content through multiple API surfaces. Click each node below to trace how data moves through the system.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-data-flow">How data flows through Payload</SectionSubheading>

The entire system starts with your `payload.config.ts` file. From there, Payload auto-generates the database schema, admin panel, API endpoints, and TypeScript types. Click each node to see what that layer does.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-database">Database adapters</SectionSubheading>

Payload uses a **database adapter pattern**. You choose your database — PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM), MongoDB, or SQLite — and Payload handles the rest. The adapter is swappable, so you can change databases without rewriting your schema.

<Gotcha>
Payload auto-manages migrations for PostgreSQL. When you change your collection schemas, Payload generates migration files that you can review and apply — similar to how Rails or Django handle schema changes.

  <DefRow term="MongoDB" definition="Native driver. Schema-flexible. Good for rapid prototyping or document-heavy data." />
  <DefRow term="SQLite" definition="File-based. Great for local development, edge deployments (Cloudflare D1), or small projects." />
