<SectionSubheading id="toc-join-field">The join field</SectionSubheading>

Payload 3.0 introduced the `join` field type, enabling **reverse relationships at the database level**. If a `Movie` has a relationship to a `Director`, you can add a join field on `Director` to surface all their movies — without manual queries or N+1 problems. This is performant, database-level joining.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-deployment">Deployment flexibility</SectionSubheading>

Payload deploys anywhere Node.js runs:

  <ColItem>**Vercel** — serverless, one-click deployment templates</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Cloudflare Workers** — with D1 (SQLite) and R2 (storage)</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Traditional servers** — Docker, VPS, bare metal</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Self-hosted** — Coolify, Railway, or your own infrastructure</ColItem>

<Explainer title="Leaner in v3">
In Payload 3.0, the dependency count dropped from 88 to 27, making it significantly leaner and faster to install and deploy.
