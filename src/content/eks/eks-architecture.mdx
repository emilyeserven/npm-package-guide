<SectionIntro>
An EKS cluster has two main layers: the **control plane** (managed by AWS) and the **data plane** (your worker nodes where pods actually run). Understanding this split is key to understanding what you're paying for and what you're responsible for.

The control plane runs the API server, etcd, scheduler, and controller manager across multiple availability zones. AWS manages all of this — patches, backups, scaling. The data plane is where your pods actually run on worker nodes that you configure.

EKS gives you three ways to run your workloads. Each trades off control for convenience:
