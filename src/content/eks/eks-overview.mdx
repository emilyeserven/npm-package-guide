<SectionIntro>
**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** is AWS's managed Kubernetes service. It runs the Kubernetes control plane for you — the API server, etcd database, scheduler, and controllers — across multiple availability zones so you don't have to operate, patch, or worry about the most complex part of Kubernetes.

<Explainer heading="As a frontend engineer">
You'll mostly interact with EKS through deployment configs, CI/CD pipelines, and kubectl commands. You don't need to manage servers — but understanding the architecture helps you debug and ship faster.
