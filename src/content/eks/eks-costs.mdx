<SectionIntro>
EKS pricing is straightforward but the total cost depends heavily on your compute choices. The control plane is a flat fee; everything else depends on how you run your workloads.

<Explainer heading="Cost optimization playbook">
Use Spot instances for non-critical workloads (up to 90% savings). Right-size pods with VPA. Use Karpenter to bin-pack efficiently. Consolidate ALBs. Monitor with Kubecost or AWS Cost Explorer.

<SectionNote>
A minimal production EKS cluster (control plane + 2x t3.medium nodes + ALB) costs roughly $150–200/month. That's the floor. Scale from there based on workload needs.
