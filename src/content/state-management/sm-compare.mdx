<Gotcha>
**There is no single "best" tool.** Context is free and simple but limited. Zustand is tiny and flexible with great re-render control. Redux is structured and battle-tested but heavier. Pick the one that matches your app's complexity — and remember that **server state** (API data) should live in React Query, not in any of these.
