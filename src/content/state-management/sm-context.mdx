<SectionIntro>
React Context is the built-in way to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling. It's not technically a state manager — it's a **dependency injection mechanism**. Perfect for values that change rarely and affect many components.

<ColItem>**Zero dependencies** — Context ships with React, so there's nothing extra to install.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Simple mental model** — a Provider wraps a subtree, and any component below can consume the value with `useContext`.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**The catch** — every consumer re-renders when *any* value in the context changes. There are no built-in selectors, so you can't subscribe to just a slice of state.</ColItem>
