<SectionIntro>
Everything that happens between your <code>fetch("/api/chat")</code> and the AI response involves multiple infrastructure layers working together. This guide breaks down each one using analogies to systems you already know.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-whats-behind">What's Behind the API Call</SectionSubheading>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>When you call an AI API from your frontend, the request passes through at least three infrastructure layers before a single token is generated. Understanding these layers helps you debug latency issues, architect better integrations, and have informed conversations with ML engineers.</ColItem>
<ColItem>The AI infrastructure stack has strong parallels to concepts frontend engineers already know &mdash; Express middleware, data-fetching patterns, and React state management all have direct counterparts. The concepts are familiar, even if the specific technologies are new.</ColItem>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>**<NavLink to="ai-inference">Inference & Serving</NavLink>** &mdash; The layer closest to your frontend. Handles API routing, model serving, streaming responses, and load balancing across GPU servers.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**<NavLink to="ai-orchestration">Orchestration & Pipelines</NavLink>** &mdash; The business logic layer. Chains together retrieval, prompting, model calls, guardrails, and agent workflows into real products.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**<NavLink to="ai-data">Data & Vector Storage</NavLink>** &mdash; How AI apps remember things. Embeddings, vector databases, document processing, and feature stores for context and personalization.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**<NavLink to="ai-training">Training & Fine-Tuning</NavLink>** &mdash; How models get smart. Pre-training, fine-tuning, RLHF alignment, and systematic evaluation of model quality.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**<NavLink to="ai-compute">Infrastructure & Compute</NavLink>** &mdash; The physical foundation. GPU clusters, container orchestration, model registries, and observability for AI workloads.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="You're already closer than you think">
As a frontend engineer, you interact with the **inference layer** every time your React app calls an AI API, and you may touch the **orchestration layer** when building features with RAG or prompt management. The deeper layers &mdash; training and infrastructure &mdash; are typically handled by ML engineers, but understanding them helps you debug latency issues, architect better integrations, and have informed conversations with your backend and ML teams.
