<SectionIntro>
Foundation models are pre-trained on massive datasets by large labs. Fine-tuning adapts them to specific tasks with smaller, domain-specific data. While you likely won't train models from scratch, understanding this layer helps you evaluate when fine-tuning is worth the investment and how to work with ML teams.

<ColItem>Think of the training pipeline as a CI/CD system for models. Raw data goes in, trained models come out, and evaluation benchmarks act as your test suite. The tools are different but the workflow is familiar.</ColItem>
<ColItem>The most relevant concept for engineers building AI features is **fine-tuning** &mdash; taking an existing model and specializing it with your data. This is dramatically cheaper and faster than pre-training, and services like OpenAI make it accessible via API.</ColItem>
