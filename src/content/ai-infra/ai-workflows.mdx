<SectionIntro>
The infrastructure layers from the previous pages combine in predictable patterns. These four workflows cover the vast majority of production AI systems &mdash; from a simple chatbot to a full fine-tuning pipeline.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-overview">Overview</SectionSubheading>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>Each workflow traces a request through the infrastructure stack, showing which layers are involved and in what order. Notice how simpler workflows touch fewer layers, while complex ones (like agents) loop through orchestration and data layers multiple times.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Understanding these workflows helps you estimate latency, identify bottlenecks, and choose the right architecture for your use case. A simple chat completion involves only the inference layer, while RAG adds data retrieval and orchestration overhead.</ColItem>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>**Simple Chat Completion** &mdash; the most basic pattern. Your frontend sends a prompt, the inference layer generates a response. No external data, no orchestration. <NavLink to="ai-wf-simple-chat" /></ColItem>
<ColItem>**RAG (Search + Answer)** &mdash; the system searches your data for relevant context before generating an answer. Adds data and orchestration layers on top of inference. <NavLink to="ai-wf-rag" /></ColItem>
<ColItem>**AI Agent Workflow** &mdash; the model decides what tools to call in a loop, reasoning through multi-step tasks like a coding assistant. The most dynamic pattern. <NavLink to="ai-wf-agent" /></ColItem>
<ColItem>**Model Fine-Tuning Pipeline** &mdash; specialize a base model on your data through the full training pipeline &mdash; from data preparation to deployment. The most complex pattern. <NavLink to="ai-wf-finetune" /></ColItem>

<Explainer title="Start simple, add layers as needed">
Most AI features should start as a **simple chat completion**. Add RAG when the model needs access to your data. Graduate to an agent workflow only when the task requires multi-step reasoning with tool use. Fine-tuning is a last resort for when prompt engineering and RAG aren't enough &mdash; it requires training data, evaluation infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance.
