<SectionIntro>
The infrastructure layers from the previous pages combine in predictable patterns. These four workflows cover the vast majority of production AI systems &mdash; from a simple chatbot to a full fine-tuning pipeline.

<SectionList>
<ColItem>Each workflow traces a request through the infrastructure stack, showing which layers are involved and in what order. Notice how simpler workflows touch fewer layers, while complex ones (like agents) loop through orchestration and data layers multiple times.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Understanding these workflows helps you estimate latency, identify bottlenecks, and choose the right architecture for your use case. A simple chat completion involves only the inference layer, while RAG adds data retrieval and orchestration overhead.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="Start simple, add layers as needed">
Most AI features should start as a **simple chat completion**. Add RAG when the model needs access to your data. Graduate to an agent workflow only when the task requires multi-step reasoning with tool use. Fine-tuning is a last resort for when prompt engineering and RAG aren't enough &mdash; it requires training data, evaluation infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance.
