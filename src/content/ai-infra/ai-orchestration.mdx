<SectionIntro>
This is where "just call the model" becomes a real product. The orchestration layer chains together retrieval, prompting, model calls, and post-processing into coherent workflows. If you've built middleware pipelines or service orchestration, you'll recognize the patterns.

<SectionList>
<ColItem>Raw model calls are like raw database queries &mdash; technically functional but not how you build applications. The orchestration layer adds the structure, validation, and business logic that turns model capabilities into reliable features.</ColItem>
<ColItem>This layer is where most of the "AI engineering" happens in practice. You'll compose retrieval pipelines, manage prompt versions, build agent loops, and add safety guardrails &mdash; all using patterns that map directly to familiar backend concepts.</ColItem>
