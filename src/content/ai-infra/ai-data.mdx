<SectionIntro>
AI apps need special databases. Vector databases store "embeddings" &mdash; numerical representations of text and images that let you find semantically similar content. If you've worked with search engines like Elasticsearch, you'll find the concepts familiar but the technique different.

<ColItem>Traditional databases answer "give me the exact match." Vector databases answer "give me things that are similar." This enables semantic search, recommendation systems, and the retrieval step in RAG pipelines.</ColItem>
<ColItem>The data layer also handles document processing (chunking PDFs and web pages into embeddable pieces) and feature stores (precomputed signals injected into prompts for personalization).</ColItem>
