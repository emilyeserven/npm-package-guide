<ColItem>**Token** &mdash; The basic unit models work with. Roughly &frac34; of a word. "Hello world" &asymp; 2 tokens. Token count determines API pricing and context window usage.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Latency** &mdash; Time to first token (TTFT) + time per output token. Your users feel both. Streaming helps mask generation latency by showing tokens as they arrive.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Context Window** &mdash; Max tokens a model can process at once (input + output). GPT-4: 128K tokens, Claude: 200K tokens. Exceeding it causes truncation or errors.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Hallucination** &mdash; When the model confidently generates incorrect information. RAG (grounding responses in retrieved documents) and guardrails help reduce this.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Inference** &mdash; Running a trained model to get predictions. This is the "production" phase &mdash; analogous to handling API requests on your backend server.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Embedding** &mdash; A vector (list of numbers) representing the semantic meaning of text. Similar texts produce similar vectors, enabling search by meaning instead of keywords.</ColItem>
