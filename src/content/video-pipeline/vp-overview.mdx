<SectionIntro>
Every time you watch a video online, an invisible pipeline has already processed, compressed, split, and delivered that content to you. Understanding this pipeline is the foundation for everything else in this guide.

Click any stage below to understand what happens at each step of the video delivery journey:

The pipeline transforms raw camera footage into something that can be streamed smoothly over the internet. Each stage has a specific job:

<SectionList>
<ColItem>**Capture** records the raw video and wraps it in an initial container format.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Inspect** reads the file's metadata to understand its codec, resolution, and bitrate.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Transcode** re-encodes the video into multiple quality levels optimized for different devices and networks.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Package** segments each quality level into small chunks with manifest playlists.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Deliver** pushes the segments to a CDN for global, low-latency access.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Play** uses adaptive bitrate algorithms to switch quality seamlessly during playback.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

Understanding the pipeline helps you make informed decisions about video infrastructure. Without this knowledge, you might serve a single massive file that buffers constantly, choose the wrong codec for your audience, or skip critical optimizations like adaptive bitrate streaming.

<Explainer title="The scale of the problem">
An uncompressed 1080p frame is roughly 6 MB. At 30 frames per second, that's 180 MB per second — or about 10.8 GB per minute. A 2-hour movie would be over 1 terabyte. Every stage of the pipeline exists to make this manageable.
