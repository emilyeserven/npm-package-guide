<SectionIntro>
**ffprobe** is the diagnostic tool in the FFmpeg suite. Before you transcode anything, you need to understand what you're working with — the codec, resolution, bitrate, frame rate, audio channels, and more.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-what">What is ffprobe?</SectionSubheading>

ffprobe reads a video file and reports everything about its structure. It's the first tool you reach for when working with any video file — it tells you exactly what's inside before you decide how to process it.

<pre><code>{`# Basic info about a file

<SectionNote>
ffprobe output tells you exactly what codecs you're dealing with, what resolution and frame rate the source is, and what bitrate it was encoded at. This is critical information before transcoding — you can't make informed encoding decisions without it.
