# Iterate over a list
for FRUIT in apple banana cherry; do
  echo "I like $FRUIT"
done

# Iterate over files
for FILE in src/*.ts; do

<SectionSubheading id="toc-while">While Loops & Reading Lines</SectionSubheading>

<CodeAccordion title="Reading lines safely" ext="bash">
```bash
# Read a file line by line (handles spaces correctly)
while IFS= read -r LINE; do
  echo "Line: $LINE"
done < input.txt

# Process command output line by line
git diff --name-only | while IFS= read -r FILE; do
  echo "Changed: $FILE"
done
```
</CodeAccordion>

<Gotcha>
`for LINE in $(cat file)` splits on spaces and glob-expands. Always use `while read` to read files line by line.
