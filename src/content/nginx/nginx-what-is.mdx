<SectionIntro>
Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is an open-source web server that also serves as a reverse proxy, load balancer, HTTP cache, and mail proxy. Created by Igor Sysoev in 2004 to solve the C10K problem — handling 10,000+ concurrent connections — it's now the most widely used web server on the internet.

Nginx uses a master-worker process model with non-blocking, event-driven I/O. A single master process manages configuration and spawns worker processes, each of which can handle thousands of simultaneous connections.
