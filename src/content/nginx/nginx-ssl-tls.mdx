<SectionIntro>
HTTPS is non-negotiable for production. Nginx handles TLS termination — decrypting incoming HTTPS traffic and passing plain HTTP to your backend, offloading the encryption overhead from your app servers.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-why">Why HTTPS matters</SectionSubheading>

Without TLS, all traffic between the browser and your server is plain text. Anyone on the network can read passwords, session tokens, and API responses. Modern browsers also block features like Service Workers, WebAuthn, and Geolocation on non-HTTPS origins.

```nginx
# Step 1: Install certbot
# sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

# Step 2: Obtain certificate (auto-configures nginx)
# sudo certbot --nginx -d mysite.com -d www.mysite.com

# Step 3: Certbot generates something like this:
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name mysite.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/mysite.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mysite.com/privkey.pem;

    # Modern TLS settings
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;

    # HSTS — tell browsers to always use HTTPS
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security
        "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains" always;

    location / {
        root /var/www/mysite/dist;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}

# Redirect HTTP → HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mysite.com www.mysite.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

<Gotcha>
Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days. Certbot sets up automatic renewal via a systemd timer or cron job. Run `sudo certbot renew --dry-run` to verify auto-renewal works.
</Gotcha>
