<SectionIntro>
Zustand (German for "state") is a small, fast, and scalable state management library for React. It uses a simplified flux-inspired approach with hooks — no providers, no boilerplate, no context wrappers.

A Zustand store is created with the `create` function. It takes a callback that receives `set` and `get` as arguments.

The store returns a hook you call directly in your components. No providers needed.

The `set` function **shallowly merges** by default — you only need to return the properties you want to update.

<SectionNote>
Pass `true` as the second arg to **replace** the entire state instead of merging: `set(newState, true)`. This is rarely needed but useful for resetting to initial state.
