<SectionIntro>
As your app grows, you have two choices: many small stores, or one big store with slices. Both work, but the slices pattern gives you the benefits of a single store (cross-slice access) with the organization of separate files.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-creating">Creating Slices</SectionSubheading>

Each slice is a plain function that receives `set`, `get`, and `store` — just like the main `create` callback.

<SectionNote>
**Watch for key collisions.** Since slices are merged into a flat object, make sure your property and action names don't collide across slices. Prefix if needed: `cartItems` vs `userItems`.
