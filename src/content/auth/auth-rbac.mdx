<SectionIntro>
Backend engineers know RBAC deeply — middleware that checks roles before processing a request. The frontend uses the same patterns for a different purpose: improving UX by hiding actions the user can't perform. Each pattern below shows frontend and backend code side by side. Click to expand.

<Explainer title="Frontend checks are UX, backend checks are security">
Every frontend permission check should mirror a backend check. The frontend says "should I show this button?" and the backend says "is this request allowed?" If they ever disagree, trust the backend. The best pattern is permission-aware API responses — let the server tell the frontend what the user can do, so you never have to duplicate authorization logic.
