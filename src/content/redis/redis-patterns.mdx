<SectionIntro>
Knowing Redis commands is one thing — understanding the patterns behind your favorite app's speed is another. These five patterns explain why pages load instantly, chats feel real-time, and API abuse gets blocked before it reaches the database.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-intro">Why patterns matter</SectionSubheading>

Each pattern solves a specific frontend performance problem. Cache-aside is why your product page loads in 50ms. Pub/Sub is how your chat messages arrive instantly. Rate limiting is why bots can't hammer your login endpoint. Understanding these helps you debug performance issues, architect better data-fetching strategies, and communicate with backend teams. Click "Show implementation" on any pattern to see the code.
