<SectionIntro>
You don't need to operate Redis to benefit from understanding its architecture. Knowing why it's fast helps you make better decisions about caching strategies, debug slow API responses, and understand the trade-offs when your backend team discusses infrastructure.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-overview">Overview</SectionSubheading>

Redis achieves its speed through three architectural choices: in-memory storage (why `fetch()` responses are fast), a single-threaded event loop (why operations are atomic and race-condition-free), and purpose-built data structures (why a leaderboard query is O(log N) instead of O(N log N)).
