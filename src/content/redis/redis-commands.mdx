<SectionIntro>
Your API's Redis usage comes down to about 20 commands. You won't type these in production — your API code does. But understanding them helps you debug caching issues, read backend code, and understand why certain endpoints are fast or slow.

Select a category to see the commands that power caching, sessions, real-time features, and more.

<Gotcha>
If your API uses `KEYS` in production, it blocks the entire Redis server (single-threaded!) until the scan completes. This can freeze every API response your frontend is waiting for. Use `SCAN` instead.
</Gotcha>
