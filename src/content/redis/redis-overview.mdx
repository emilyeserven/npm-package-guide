<SectionIntro>
Every time your React app loads data in milliseconds instead of seconds, there's often a caching layer involved. Redis is the most widely used one — an in-memory data store that sits between your frontend and the database, making API responses instant.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-what-is">What is Redis?</SectionSubheading>

Think of Redis as `localStorage` for your server. Just like `localStorage` lets your frontend store data in the browser for fast access, Redis lets your API server store data in RAM. The difference? Redis is shared across all users, supports rich data structures, and auto-expires data with TTL.

When your dashboard calls `fetch('/api/user/me')`, the API checks Redis first. If the data is there (a "cache hit"), it returns in under 1ms. If not (a "cache miss"), it queries the database (~50ms), caches the result in Redis for next time, and returns it.

But caching is just the beginning. Redis also powers session management (how your login persists), rate limiting (how your API blocks abuse), real-time features (how your chat messages arrive instantly), and more. It's the invisible layer behind most of the fast apps you use every day.

When your `fetch()` call hits an API backed by Redis, here's the difference it makes:

This simulated terminal shows what happens on the server when your frontend makes API calls. Try `SET api:cache:user:1 "Emily"` then `GET api:cache:user:1`. Type `HELP` for available commands.
