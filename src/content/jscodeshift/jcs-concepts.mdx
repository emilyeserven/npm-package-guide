<SectionIntro>
**jscodeshift** is a toolkit built by Facebook that wraps the **recast** parser/printer and provides a jQuery-like API for searching and transforming Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). It lets you write *codemods* — programmatic transformations that can modify thousands of files automatically while preserving formatting.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-what">What is jscodeshift?</SectionSubheading>

jscodeshift combines a powerful AST manipulation API with a CLI runner that can process your entire codebase in parallel. Unlike simple text-based transformations, it understands your code's *structure* — making refactors precise, reliable, and repeatable.

<Explainer title="Key insight">
**recast** is what makes jscodeshift special. Unlike Babel's generator, recast preserves original formatting, comments, and whitespace for any AST nodes you *don't* touch. Only transformed nodes get reprinted.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-why">Why not find-and-replace?</SectionSubheading>

Regex-based find-and-replace is brittle. It can't distinguish a variable named `color` from a string `"color"` from a property `.color`. AST-based transforms understand your code's *structure*, not just its text, so they're far more precise and reliable.

Understanding ASTs is the single most important skill for writing codemods. Use [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net) (set parser to **recast** and transform to **jscodeshift**) to interactively see how source code maps to tree nodes.
