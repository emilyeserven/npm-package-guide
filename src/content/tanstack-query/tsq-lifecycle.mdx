<Gotcha>
A common source of confusion: **`isLoading` vs `isFetching`**. `isLoading` is true only on the initial load (no cached data). `isFetching` is true during any network request, including background refetches. During a background refetch, `isLoading` is false (cached data is being shown) but `isFetching` is true.
