<SectionIntro>
Fetch a list of users. Handle loading, errors, caching, race conditions, and cleanup — all with the same result, but very different levels of effort.

<Explainer title="Key takeaway">
The TanStack Query version isn't just shorter — it's **declarative**. You describe *what data you need* and *how fresh it should be*. The library handles the how: caching, deduplication, retries, background refetching, and garbage collection.

The other approaches are **imperative** — you manually orchestrate every step of the data lifecycle, and each component re-implements the same patterns differently.
