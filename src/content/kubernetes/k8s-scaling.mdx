<SectionIntro>
Keeping your app healthy under load. You know how CDNs auto-scale and health checks keep origins responsive? K8s can auto-scale your backend pods and use probes to route traffic only to healthy instances.

<ColItem>Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) adds or removes pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics. Liveness probes restart unhealthy containers. Readiness probes prevent traffic to pods that aren't ready yet.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="Remember this">
Probes keep your app healthy &mdash; liveness restarts broken containers, readiness controls traffic flow. HPA scales pods automatically based on load. Together they make your app self-healing and elastic.
