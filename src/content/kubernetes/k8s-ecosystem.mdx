<SectionIntro>
Just like the frontend world has Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Storybook... the infra world has its own ecosystem of tools around K8s. You don't need to learn all of these &mdash; just know they exist.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-concepts">{'\u{1F30D}'} Ecosystem tools</SectionSubheading>

<DefinitionTable termHeader="Tool" descHeader="What it does">
  <DefRow term="kubectl">The CLI for Kubernetes &mdash; like &ldquo;npm&rdquo; or &ldquo;git&rdquo; but for your cluster. kubectl get pods, kubectl logs, kubectl apply.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="ArgoCD / Flux">GitOps tools &mdash; they watch a Git repo and auto-deploy when you push changes. Like Vercel&rsquo;s GitHub integration but for K8s.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="Terraform">Creates the underlying infrastructure (VMs, networks, databases) that K8s runs ON. If K8s manages apps, Terraform manages the machines.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="Prometheus + Grafana">Monitoring stack. Prometheus collects metrics, Grafana visualizes them. Like browser DevTools performance tab for your infra.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="Istio / Service Mesh">Manages communication between services &mdash; encryption, retries, traffic splitting. Like a middleware layer for your microservices.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="ConfigMaps &amp; Secrets">K8s resources for config and sensitive data. ConfigMap &asymp; .env file, Secret &asymp; .env with encryption for passwords/API keys.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="CI/CD Pipeline">GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. Builds your Docker image, pushes it to a registry, then tells Helm/K8s to deploy it.</DefRow>
</DefinitionTable>

<Explainer title="Remember this">
You don't need to learn all of these! Just know they exist so you can follow conversations with your infra team.
