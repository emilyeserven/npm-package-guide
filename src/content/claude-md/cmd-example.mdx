# Acme Dashboard

Internal analytics dashboard for the sales team.
React SPA with TanStack Router, TanStack Query, and Zustand.

## Stack

- TypeScript (strict mode)
- React 19 + Vite
- TanStack Router (file-based routes in src/routes/)
- TanStack Query for server state
- Zustand for client state (stores in src/stores/)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vitest + React Testing Library for tests

## Commands

- pnpm dev             # dev server on :5173
- pnpm build           # production build
- pnpm test:unit       # run unit tests
- pnpm test -- path    # run a single test file
- pnpm typecheck       # TypeScript check
- pnpm lint:fix        # auto-fix with Biome

## Workflow

- Run typecheck after code changes
- Prefer running single tests, not the full suite
- Use Biome for formatting (do not format manually)
- Commit messages: conventional commits (feat:, fix:, chore:)

## Architecture

- API client: src/lib/api.ts (wraps fetch with auth headers)
- Auth: see src/stores/authStore.ts for the pattern
- Shared components: src/components/ui/ (shadcn-based)
- Route loaders handle data fetching via TanStack Query

## Guides

- Testing patterns: @docs/testing.md
- API conventions: @docs/api-patterns.md
- Component guidelines: @docs/components.md
