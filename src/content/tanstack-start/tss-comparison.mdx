<SectionSubheading id="toc-overview">Two approaches to full-stack React</SectionSubheading>

TanStack Start is **client-first** — the browser is the primary runtime, and the server is a tool you reach for when needed. Next.js is **server-first** — components render on the server by default, and you opt into client interactivity. Neither approach is universally better; the right choice depends on your project's needs.
