The fastest way to start is by cloning the official template. You can also set up from scratch if you prefer understanding each piece.

TanStack Start uses `app.config.ts` as its main configuration file, which extends Vite's config with Start-specific options like server presets for different deployment targets. The dev server starts at `http://localhost:5173` with instant HMR powered by Vite.

<Gotcha title="Pin Your Versions">
During the RC phase, lock your TanStack dependencies to a specific version (e.g., `1.0.0-rc.5` instead of `^1.0.0-rc.5`) to avoid unexpected breaking changes between releases.
</Gotcha>
