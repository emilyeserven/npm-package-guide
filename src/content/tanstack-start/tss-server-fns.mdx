<SectionIntro>
Server functions are TanStack Start's mechanism for running code on the server with **full type safety across the network boundary**. They can replace tRPC, GraphQL, or REST for most use cases.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-overview">What are server functions?</SectionSubheading>

A server function is created with `createServerFn()`. It runs on the server but can be called from anywhere — components, loaders, or other server functions. Input validation with Zod ensures type safety at the network boundary, and the validated types flow through to your handler automatically.

<SectionNote>
When called from the server (like during SSR), the function simply executes directly. When called from the browser, TanStack automatically makes a network request to an internal endpoint that runs the function. The developer experience is the same either way — you just call the function.
