<SectionIntro>
Middleware lets you compose reusable logic that runs before server functions or request handlers. They're **fully typed, composable, and can inject context** that downstream functions receive with type safety.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-overview">What is middleware?</SectionSubheading>

Middleware in TanStack Start is created with `createMiddleware()`. Each middleware can validate requests, inject typed context, and chain with other middleware. The context flows through the chain with full type inference — no manual type annotations needed.

This is particularly powerful for authentication: create an `authMiddleware` once, then attach it to any server function that needs a verified user in context.
