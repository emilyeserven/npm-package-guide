<SectionIntro>
Data loading in TanStack Start combines **route loaders** with server functions. Loaders run before the route renders, ensuring data is available immediately — on the server during SSR and on the client during navigation.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-overview">How data loading works</SectionSubheading>

Each route can define a `loader` function that fetches data before the component renders. Loaders run in parallel with parent loaders (no waterfalls), and the return value is fully typed when accessed via `Route.useLoaderData()`. For more advanced caching and background revalidation, you can integrate TanStack Query directly in your loaders.

<Gotcha title="Static Server Functions">
When using `staticFunctionMiddleware`, make sure it's the **last** middleware in the chain. The function runs at build time and its result is cached as a static JSON asset.
</Gotcha>
