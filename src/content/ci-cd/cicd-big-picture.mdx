<SectionIntro>
Imagine you're working on a React app with a team. Someone pushes code that breaks the build. Nobody notices until Friday deploy. Chaos ensues. CI/CD prevents this by automating the boring, error-prone stuff.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-ci">Continuous Integration (CI)</SectionSubheading>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>Every time code is pushed, automatically run tests, lint, and build &mdash; catch problems **immediately**.</ColItem>
<ColItem>No more "it worked on my machine" &mdash; the same checks run on a clean, reproducible environment every time.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Failed checks block the merge, so broken code never reaches the main branch.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-cd">Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)</SectionSubheading>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>Once CI passes, automatically deploy to staging or production. No manual steps.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Continuous Delivery** means the code is always *ready* to deploy (but a human clicks the button).</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Continuous Deployment** goes further &mdash; every passing build is deployed automatically, no human in the loop.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-analogy">The factory analogy</SectionSubheading>

<Explainer title="Think of it like a factory assembly line">
Raw materials (your code) go in one end, pass through quality checks (tests, linting), and a finished product (deployed app) comes out the other end &mdash; automatically. If any station on the line detects a defect, the conveyor stops and the team is notified immediately.
