<SectionIntro>
A CI/CD pipeline is an automated sequence of stages that your code passes through from push to production. Each stage has a specific job, and if any stage fails, the pipeline stops. Here are the five stages you'll see in almost every pipeline.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-flow">How they connect</SectionSubheading>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>Stages run **sequentially** by default &mdash; each one must pass before the next begins.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Some stages (like Test and Lint) can run **in parallel** to save time, since they don't depend on each other's output.</ColItem>
<ColItem>If any stage fails, the pipeline stops and the team is notified. The PR cannot be merged until everything passes.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="Pipeline stages &mdash; a backend analogy">
If you've worked with database migrations or build scripts, you already know this pattern. A pipeline is just a formalized version of the steps you'd run manually: install, check, test, ship. The difference is that it runs automatically on every push and blocks merges when something fails.
