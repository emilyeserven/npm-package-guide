<SectionIntro>
GitHub Actions is GitHub's built-in CI/CD tool. It's free for public repos and has generous free-tier minutes for private ones. You define your pipelines as YAML files inside <code>.github/workflows/</code> in your repo.<FnRef n={1} />

<SectionList>
<ColItem>**Built into GitHub** &mdash; no separate service to sign up for. Enable it in any repo by adding a YAML file.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Event-driven** &mdash; workflows trigger on pushes, PRs, schedules, manual buttons, issue events, and more.<FnRef n={2} /></ColItem>
<ColItem>**Extensible** &mdash; a marketplace of thousands of reusable Actions (like npm packages for CI) lets you avoid reinventing the wheel.</ColItem>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>**Workflow** &mdash; A YAML file that defines an automated process. Lives in <code>.github/workflows/</code>. You can have multiple workflows per repo.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Event (Trigger)** &mdash; What starts the workflow: <code>push</code>, <code>pull_request</code>, <code>schedule</code> (cron), <code>workflow_dispatch</code> (manual button), or even "when an issue is opened."</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Job** &mdash; A group of steps that run on the same runner (virtual machine). Jobs run in parallel by default, but you can make them sequential with <code>needs:</code>.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Step** &mdash; A single task inside a job &mdash; run a shell command or use a pre-built Action.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Action** &mdash; A reusable, community-built plugin. Like npm packages but for CI. Example: <code>actions/checkout@v4</code> clones your repo.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**Runner** &mdash; The virtual machine that executes your job. GitHub provides Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS runners. You can also self-host (important for airgapped environments!).</ColItem>
