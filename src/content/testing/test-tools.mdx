<ColItem>**For a Vite project**, start with **Vitest** for unit and component tests &mdash; it shares your Vite config, so setup is minimal. Add **React Testing Library** for component tests and **Playwright** for E2E.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**For an existing Jest project**, there's no urgent need to migrate. Jest works great and has the largest ecosystem. Add RTL for components and Playwright or Cypress for E2E.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**For visual testing**, **Storybook** lets you develop components in isolation and catch visual regressions. It complements your test runner rather than replacing it.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**For E2E**, **Playwright** is the current industry favorite &mdash; it's fast, reliable, and supports all major browsers. **Cypress** has a friendlier developer experience but less browser coverage.</ColItem>
