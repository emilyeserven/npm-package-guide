<SectionIntro>
Unit tests verify a single function, hook, or module **in complete isolation**. All external dependencies are mocked or stubbed, so each test checks exactly one piece of logic. They're the fastest and cheapest tests you can write.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-what">{'\uD83E\uDDE9'} What are unit tests?</SectionSubheading>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>A unit test targets the **smallest testable piece** of your code &mdash; a pure function, a utility helper, a data transformer, or a custom hook.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Because everything external is mocked, unit tests run in **milliseconds** and rarely flake. They form the wide base of the testing pyramid.</ColItem>
<ColItem>The goal is to verify **inputs produce expected outputs** without worrying about rendering, DOM, or network calls.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="Unit tests &mdash; a backend analogy">
Backend unit tests are the exact same concept. Testing a `calculateTax(amount, region)` function with different inputs and asserting on the output is a unit test in any language. The frontend version just targets things like `formatCurrency()`, `validateEmail()`, or custom React hooks instead of service methods.
