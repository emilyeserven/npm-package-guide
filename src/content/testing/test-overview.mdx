<SectionIntro>
The testing pyramid is a model that helps you decide **how many tests of each type to write**. More tests at the bottom (fast, cheap, isolated), fewer at the top (slow, expensive, realistic). Click any level below to learn more about that test type.

<SectionList>
<ColItem>**~70% Unit Tests** &mdash; Fast, cheap, and focused. Cover all your utility functions, data transformers, hooks, and business logic. These are the foundation of your test suite.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**~20% Component Tests** &mdash; Medium speed and cost. Verify that your UI components render correctly, respond to interactions, and call the right callbacks.</ColItem>
<ColItem>**~10% E2E Tests** &mdash; Slow but high confidence. Cover only the critical user paths: signup, login, checkout, and other key workflows.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<Explainer title="Testing pyramid &mdash; a backend analogy">
If you've written tests for a backend service, you already know this model. **Unit tests** are like testing individual service methods or helper functions. **Component tests** are like testing a single API endpoint with a mocked database. **E2E tests** are like spinning up the full service, hitting it with HTTP requests, and asserting on the responses &mdash; including the database. The pyramid just says: write more of the cheap ones, fewer of the expensive ones.
