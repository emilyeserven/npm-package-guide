<SectionIntro>
End-to-end tests drive a **real browser** through complete user workflows. They test the full stack &mdash; frontend, API, and database &mdash; exactly as a real user would experience it. They're the most realistic tests but also the slowest and most expensive.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-what">{'\uD83C\uDF10'} What are E2E tests?</SectionSubheading>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>E2E tests launch a real browser (Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit), navigate to your app, click buttons, fill forms, and assert that the right things happen on screen.</ColItem>
<ColItem>They catch integration bugs that lower-level tests miss: broken API contracts, auth redirects, cookie handling, and cross-page navigation flows.</ColItem>
<ColItem>Because they're slow and can be flaky, you should **only write E2E tests for critical user paths** &mdash; the flows that would cost you money or users if they broke.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="E2E tests &mdash; a backend analogy">
E2E tests are like integration tests that spin up your entire backend, including the database, and make real HTTP requests. In a backend context, you might test "user signs up, verifies email, and can log in" as one flow. Frontend E2E tests do the same thing but through the browser UI &mdash; clicking the signup button, filling in the form, checking the inbox, and verifying the dashboard loads.
