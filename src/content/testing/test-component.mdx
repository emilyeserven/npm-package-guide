<SectionIntro>
Component tests render a React component (or small component tree) and assert on **what the user sees and can interact with** &mdash; not internal state or implementation details. They bridge the gap between unit tests and full E2E tests.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-what">{'\uD83E\uDDF1'} What are component tests?</SectionSubheading>

<SectionList>
<ColItem>Component tests use a **simulated DOM** (like jsdom) to render your component, then query for elements the same way a user would &mdash; by role, label, or text content.</ColItem>
<ColItem>They verify **rendered output and interactions**: does the button appear? Does clicking it call the callback? Does the error message show when validation fails?</ColItem>
<ColItem>The key principle: **test what the user sees**, not how the component is built internally. If you refactor the component and behavior stays the same, no tests should break.</ColItem>

<Explainer title="Component tests &mdash; a backend analogy">
Think of component tests like testing a single API endpoint. You send a request (render with props), the endpoint processes it (component renders), and you assert on the response (DOM output). You don't check what SQL queries ran internally &mdash; you check that the response body is correct. Similarly, component tests check what rendered on screen, not what state variables were set.
