<SectionIntro>
TanStack AI supports multiple transport layers. The protocol is open and documented — use SSE, HTTP streams, or build your own adapter.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-transports">Connection adapters</SectionSubheading>

Choose the transport that best fits your infrastructure:

<TsaiCodeTabs exampleId="streaming" />

<DefinitionTable>
  <DefRow term="SSE (Default)">Server-Sent Events via `fetchServerSentEvents`. The recommended transport — reliable, well-supported, and works through most proxies. Server uses `toServerSentEventsResponse()`.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="HTTP Stream">`fetchHttpStream` uses standard HTTP streaming. Useful when SSE isn't supported by your infrastructure.</DefRow>
  <DefRow term="Custom">Implement the `ConnectionAdapter` interface for WebSocket, gRPC, or any other transport. Must yield stream chunks that match the protocol.</DefRow>
</DefinitionTable>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-provider-options">Per-model type safety</SectionSubheading>

TanStack AI doesn't just abstract away provider differences — it gives you type-safe access to *provider-specific* features. Your IDE knows exactly which options are available for each model.

<CodeAccordion title="provider-options.ts" startOpen>
{`import { chat } from "@tanstack/ai"
import { openaiText } from "@tanstack/ai-openai"

// TypeScript knows which options are valid for this model
const stream = chat({
  adapter: openaiText("o1"),
  messages,
  providerOptions: {
    reasoning: {    // ← Only available on reasoning models
      effort: "high",
    },
  },
})

// Switch to GPT-4o? TypeScript flags \`reasoning\` as invalid
// because GPT-4o doesn't support it. Caught at compile time! 🎉`}
</CodeAccordion>

<Gotcha>
**Alpha Note:** TanStack AI is currently in alpha. The API surface is stabilizing but may change. Use with caution in production. The team is actively seeking feedback and contributions.
