<SectionIntro>
TanStack AI is a lightweight, framework-agnostic AI SDK that lets you build AI-powered applications with full TypeScript type safety. Think of it as the "Switzerland of AI tooling" — it connects you directly to the AI providers you choose, with no middleman and no service fees.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-what">What is TanStack AI?</SectionSubheading>

TanStack AI is currently in **alpha** (v0.5+) and is **open source under the MIT license**. Unlike vendor-specific SDKs, it gives you a single, consistent API across multiple LLM providers — swap between OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or Ollama with a one-line adapter change.

<SectionNote>
TanStack AI is built by the same team behind TanStack Query, TanStack Router, and TanStack Table — the most popular type-safe libraries in the React ecosystem.

TanStack AI is modular by design. Install only what you need — every adapter is tree-shakeable.
