<SectionIntro>
Consumers **pull** records from partitions. A **consumer group** is a set of consumers that cooperate to consume a topic — Kafka automatically distributes partitions among the group members so each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer in the group.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-pull-model">Pull-Based Consumption</SectionSubheading>

Unlike traditional message queues that push messages to consumers, Kafka consumers **pull** data at their own pace. This means:

<SectionList>
  <ColItem>**Backpressure is natural** — a slow consumer won't be overwhelmed with messages.</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Replay is possible** — consumers can seek to any offset and re-read past events.</ColItem>
  <ColItem>**Offset tracking** — each consumer tracks its position (offset) in each partition it reads from.</ColItem>
</SectionList>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-consumer-groups">Consumer Groups</SectionSubheading>

A consumer group enables parallel processing of a topic. Kafka assigns each partition to exactly one consumer within the group. When consumers join or leave, Kafka triggers a **rebalance** — redistributing partitions across the remaining members.

<Gotcha>
If you have more consumers than partitions, the extra consumers sit idle — they have no partition to read from. This is why the partition count is effectively the upper limit on consumer parallelism within a single group.
</Gotcha>

Try adjusting the number of consumers below to see how Kafka rebalances partition assignments. Notice: if you have more consumers than partitions, some consumers sit idle.
