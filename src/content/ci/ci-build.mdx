<SectionIntro>
This step compiles your TypeScript and bundles your package to verify the build succeeds. A passing build means your code is syntactically valid, all imports resolve, and the output files (JS + .d.ts types) are generated correctly. For packages, this is critical — if the build breaks, you'd publish a broken package to npm.

Run the build AFTER linting — there's no point compiling code that has lint errors. This ordering catches issues faster and saves CI minutes.
