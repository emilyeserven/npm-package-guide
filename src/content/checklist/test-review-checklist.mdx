<SectionIntro>
Use this checklist when reviewing pull requests that include tests. Click items to check them off as you go &mdash; these are the things to scan for first. This isn't about checking every box on every PR. It's a **mental model**<FnRef n={1} /> for what good tests look like. After a few reviews, these checks become instinctive. The most important ones: readable test names, behavior-focused assertions<FnRef n={2} />, and no unnecessary mocks. If a PR gets those three right, it's probably in good shape.
