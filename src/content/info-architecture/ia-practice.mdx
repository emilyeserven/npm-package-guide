<SectionIntro>
Good IA comes from research and testing, not intuition alone. This page covers practical techniques for designing, validating, and improving your information architecture.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-card-sorting">Card Sorting</SectionSubheading>

Card sorting is a research technique where you ask users to group content items into categories <FnRef n={2} />. It reveals how your audience naturally organizes information — which may differ from how *you* think about it.

**Open card sort:** Give users cards (content items) and ask them to create their own groups and name them. Reveals natural categories and labels.

**Closed card sort:** Give users cards and predefined category names. Users place cards into existing categories. Tests whether your categories make sense.

**Hybrid card sort:** Provide some predefined categories but let users add their own. Balances structure with discovery.

<Explainer title="For backend engineers">
Think of card sorting as **user-driven schema design.** Instead of designing a database schema based on your assumptions, you'd let users describe how they think the data relates. Card sorting does the same thing for content structure.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-tree-testing">Tree Testing</SectionSubheading>

Tree testing (also called "reverse card sorting") validates a proposed hierarchy <FnRef n={1} />. You present users with a text-only version of your navigation structure — no visual design, no content — and give them tasks to complete.

Example task: *"Where would you find information about deploying to production?"*

Users navigate the tree to find the answer. You measure:
- **Success rate:** Did they find it?
- **Directness:** Did they go straight there, or wander?
- **Time:** How long did it take?

<SectionNote>
Tree testing isolates the IA from the UI. Users can't rely on visual cues, page content, or search. If they can find things in a bare tree, your structure works. If they can't, no amount of visual polish will fix it.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-audit">IA Audit Checklist</SectionSubheading>

Use this checklist to evaluate an existing information architecture — whether it's a website, a codebase, or a documentation site.

**Organization**
- Can you describe the organization scheme in one sentence?
- Does every item have a clear, unambiguous home?
- Are there catch-all categories ("Other", "Miscellaneous") with more than 3 items?
- Is the hierarchy 3 levels deep or less?

**Labeling**
- Are sibling labels grammatically parallel?
- Could a new user understand every label without explanation?
- Is the same concept always called the same thing?
- Do labels describe the content, not the format ("API Reference" not "PDF document")?

**Navigation**
- Can users answer "Where am I?" from any page?
- Is every page reachable from navigation (no orphan pages)?
- Are there escape routes from every flow (back, cancel, home)?
- Does navigation remain consistent across sections?

**Search**
- Can users find content using their own vocabulary (synonyms, abbreviations)?
- Do search results show enough context to evaluate relevance?
- Are the most important pages ranked highly for obvious queries?

<SectionSubheading id="toc-iteration">Iterating on IA</SectionSubheading>

IA is never finished. Content grows, audiences change, and what worked at 10 pages breaks at 100.

<DefinitionTable>
  <DefRow term="Watch analytics" definition="High bounce rates on landing pages, frequent searches for the same terms, and low engagement on deep pages all signal IA problems." />
  <DefRow term="Track search queries" definition="What users search for reveals what they can't find through navigation. If everyone searches for 'deploy', your deploy docs are buried." />
  <DefRow term="Run periodic tree tests" definition="Test the same tasks every 6–12 months. Declining success rates mean your IA hasn't kept up with content growth." />
  <DefRow term="Review catch-all categories" definition="If 'Other' or 'Miscellaneous' keeps growing, you need new categories. Catch-all categories are IA debt." />
</DefinitionTable>

<Explainer title="The IA debt metaphor">
Like technical debt, **IA debt** accumulates when you add content without restructuring. Every page dumped into a catch-all category, every inconsistent label, every orphaned page is IA debt. Pay it down regularly or the whole structure becomes unmaintainable.
