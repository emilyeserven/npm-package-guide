<SectionIntro>
AI coding agents — Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor — navigate codebases the same way humans browse websites: by reading entry points, following paths, and building mental models. Good IA makes both humans and AI agents more effective.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-why-ai">Why AI Agents Need Good IA</SectionSubheading>

AI agents face the same challenges as human users, amplified by constraints:

<DefinitionTable>
  <DefRow term="Limited context windows" definition="Agents can only 'see' a limited amount of code at once. They need to find the right files quickly, not read everything." />
  <DefRow term="No visual cues" definition="Agents can't scan a UI layout. They rely on file names, directory structure, and explicit documentation to navigate." />
  <DefRow term="Pattern matching" definition="Agents excel at recognizing conventions. Consistent naming patterns let them infer where things are without searching." />
  <DefRow term="Entry point dependency" definition="Agents typically start from a README or CLAUDE.md. If these entry points are missing or stale, the agent starts blind." />
</DefinitionTable>

The good news: **IA that helps AI agents also helps human developers.** Every principle below has dual benefits.

<SectionSubheading id="toc-codebase">Codebase IA for Agents</SectionSubheading>

A well-architected codebase is a well-designed information space <FnRef n={1} />. Consider how this project's structure maps to IA principles:

**Predictable patterns:** Every guide follows the same file layout. An agent asked to find "the glossary terms for the IA guide" can predict the path: `src/data/glossaryTerms/iaTerms.ts`.

**Central registries:** `guideRegistry.ts` is a single file that maps guide IDs to metadata. An agent doesn't need to crawl directories — it reads one file and understands the entire guide structure.

**Self-describing content:** MDX frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `guide`) means each file carries its own metadata. An agent can identify a page's purpose without reading external config.

**Layered documentation:** `CLAUDE.md` at the root provides the big picture. `docs/CONTENT_REFERENCE.md` goes deeper. Per-guide `CLAUDE.md` files provide guide-specific context. Agents load what they need at each level.

<Explainer title="Key insight">
The best CLAUDE.md files are **information architectures for AI agents.** They answer the same three questions as navigation: Where am I? (project overview), Where can I go? (file structure, commands), How do I get there? (conventions, patterns).
</Explainer>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-context-windows">Designing for Context Windows</SectionSubheading>

AI agents have a limited amount of text they can process at once — the **context window**. This constraint makes IA decisions critically important:

**Summarize first, detail later.** A CLAUDE.md that starts with a 3-line project summary is more useful than one that starts with build instructions. Agents often only need the summary.

**Use explicit cross-references.** Instead of assuming agents will search, tell them where to look: "See `docs/CONTENT_REFERENCE.md` for MDX conventions." Direct references are cheaper than search.

**Prefer structured data over prose.** A TypeScript type definition communicates structure faster than a paragraph explaining the same thing. Types are parseable; paragraphs require interpretation.

**Keep related information co-located.** If a component's data, types, and registration are spread across 5 files, an agent needs to read all 5. If they're in 2 files, the agent's context is less cluttered.

<Gotcha>
Don't over-optimize for AI agents at the expense of human readability. If your CLAUDE.md is a machine-parseable config file with no natural language, humans won't maintain it. The best documentation serves both audiences naturally.
</Gotcha>

<SectionNote>
Progressive disclosure works for AI agents too. This project's root CLAUDE.md says "detailed conventions in docs/ — read on demand." An agent handling a simple task never loads those files. An agent writing a new guide does. Same principle as showing users a summary with an "expand" button.
