<SectionIntro>
Claude Cowork transforms file organization from tedious manual work into a single conversation. Point it at a folder, describe what you want, and step away while Claude sorts, renames, restructures, and cleans up your files.
</SectionIntro>

<SectionSubheading id="toc-what">What is Cowork?</SectionSubheading>

Cowork is a task mode in Claude Desktop that operates on your local files. Unlike Chat (conversational) or Code (programming), Cowork is designed for file management tasks: sorting, renaming, restructuring, deduplicating, and inventorying. It reads file contents to make intelligent decisions about organization.

<SectionNote>
Cowork is a research preview available on paid Claude plans. It runs locally on your machine — your files never leave your computer unless you explicitly use a cloud connector.

Not every operation is available in every context. Local file operations have the broadest support, while cloud connectors are read-only for most actions.
