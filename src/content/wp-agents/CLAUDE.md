# WordPress API & Agents Guide

## Audience & Purpose

For backend and full-stack engineers who use WordPress as a headless CMS and want to generate type-safe TypeScript interfaces, mock factories, and test fixtures from their WordPress REST API schema using Claude Code Web.

## Guide-Specific Conventions

- **Tutorial structure:** Numbered steps (1–10) with sub-steps (1a, 1b, 1c)
- **Scripts as-is:** The two MJS scripts inside `CodeAccordion` components must remain verbatim — do not edit or refactor them
- **Code examples are illustrative:** The TypeScript interfaces and mock factory examples in Steps 6–7 show what Claude Code Web *would* generate; they are not files in this project
- **Prompt blocks:** Claude Code Web prompts shown in fenced code blocks (no language tag or `text`)
